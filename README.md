# Blank-Slate


This is my project for the September Web Development Level 1 cohort. It is a mock Profile Homepage for a hypothetical business named Blank Slate Tatoo Removal. It displays informational reference points to engage potential customers. The layout is in the form of an interactive digital flyer. I designed it to attract clients that may have misgivings about the tattoo removal process, in hopes that the medical certification aspect could alleviate potential anxiety. I went for a simple column layout that can be scrolled through with ease and accessibility. 

The special instruction/system requirements to use my application are that it needs to be accessed on a PC or Mac that has Visual Studio Code installed. You can right-click on the html file and open it using Live Server. Another alternative is to use this link: https://fclay1977.github.io/Blank-Slate/ to see it hosted on GitHub Pages via a mobile device or tablet. 

I ran the accessibility check on PageSpeed Insights and got a score of 93. I created my project to be an easily viewed experience through simplistic formatting. I adjusted headers to be bold and colorful so they could stand out for straightforward readability. I didnâ€™t want there to be any degree of difficulty with the navigation of the page. Here is a link to the score: https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffclay1977.github.io%2FBlank-Slate%2F&form_factor=desktop 

 

The requirements for this project I believe I have met are listed below: 

I added my own transition animation on hover. 
  

I created a simple hide/show div with CSS and JavaScript. 

 

I can run PageSpeed Insights from google.com and get a score of 80 or better. 

 

I ran an accessibility check and documented the score and adjustments in my readme.
